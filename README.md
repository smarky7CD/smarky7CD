## Hi there 👋 I'm Sam Markelon

I’m a quantitative researcher at [Proof Trading](https://www.prooftrading.com), cryptographer by training, and systems thinker by temperament. I recently completed my PhD in computer science at the University of Florida, where I worked at the intersection of provable security, adversarial robustness, and probabilistic data structures.

You’ll find me online almost everywhere as `smarky7CD` (case-insensitive), or occasionally `smarky0x7cd`.

My research spans:
- 🔐 Secure and verifiable systems (e.g., authenticated data structures, key transparency, robust randomized algorithms)
- 📊 Probabilistic modeling and algorithmic finance
- ⚙️ Designing systems that are not only correct, but *resilient*

I’m currently focused on:
- ✳️ The robustness of data-driven systems in adversarial environments  
- 🚁 Building tools for UAV (drone) traffic monitoring

When I’m not working, I’m:
- 🧠 Reading about philosophy, probability, or strange corners of American history and culture  
- 🎥 Watching films (which I’ve recently started logging on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/smarky7cd/))  
- 🎲 Playing poker, golf, or a round of bar trivia  
- 🍝 Experimenting with new concoctions in the kitchen
